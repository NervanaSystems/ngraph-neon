# Intel速 Neon

## A Deep Learning framework powered by Intel速 nGraph

Welcome to Intel速 Neon, an open source Deep Learning framework powered by Intel速 nGraph

### Prerequisites

Installing within a virtual environment is the easiest option for most users.
To prepare for a system installation, you may skip this step.

Python3
  To create and activate a Python 3 virtualenv:

```
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ . .venv/bin/activate
```

Python 2.7
  To create and activate a Python 2 virtualenv:


```
  $ virtualenv -p python2.7 .venv
  $ . .venv/bin/activate
```

### Install nGraph (Required)

See ngraph install docs for [instructions] to build and install ngraph

### Install nGraph python binding (Required)

After installating ngraph, follow these [steps] to install the pybind wrapper

### Install Neon

Download the source code
```
  $ git clone https://github.com/NervanaSystems/ngraph-neon.git
  $ cd ngraph-neon
```

To build and install Intel Neon, keep the virtualenv activated and
simply run ``make install`` from within the clone of the repo as follows:

```
$ make install
```

### Run Neon Unit Tests

After installing Intel Neon and Intel nGraph, keep the virtualenv activated and
simply run ``make test`` from within the clone of the repo as follows:

```
$ make test
```
